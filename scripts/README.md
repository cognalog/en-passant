# Testing Scripts

This directory contains scripts for testing and monitoring the chess application.

## Scripts Overview

### `test-integration.sh`
Comprehensive integration testing script that:
- Builds and starts both backend and frontend services using Docker Compose
- Tests all API endpoints with various scenarios
- Verifies CORS configuration
- Tests configuration flexibility (custom ports and search depth)
- Validates frontend accessibility
- Provides colored output and detailed logging

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run with default configuration
./scripts/test-integration.sh

# Run with custom configuration
BACKEND_PORT=9000 BOT_SEARCH_DEPTH=3 ./scripts/test-integration.sh
```

### `health-check.sh`
Simple health monitoring script that:
- Checks if backend and frontend services are responding
- Verifies API functionality with a test request
- Returns appropriate exit codes for monitoring systems
- Can be used in production monitoring setups

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic health check
./scripts/health-check.sh

# With custom ports
BACKEND_PORT=9000 FRONTEND_PORT=3000 ./scripts/health-check.sh
```

## CI/CD Integration

These scripts are used by the GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **`scala.yml`** - Basic unit testing and compilation
2. **`integration-test.yml`** - Full integration testing using these scripts

## Testing Scenarios Covered

### API Endpoint Testing
- ‚úÖ CORS preflight requests
- ‚úÖ Move generation from initial position
- ‚úÖ Move generation with game history
- ‚úÖ Board printing functionality
- ‚úÖ Error handling for invalid requests
- ‚úÖ Multiple concurrent requests
- ‚úÖ Both White and Black color requests

### Service Testing
- ‚úÖ Backend service startup and configuration
- ‚úÖ Frontend service accessibility
- ‚úÖ JavaScript file serving
- ‚úÖ Service communication
- ‚úÖ Configuration flexibility (custom ports and search depth)

### End-to-End Testing
- ‚úÖ Complete API workflow
- ‚úÖ Service interaction
- ‚úÖ Docker container functionality
- ‚úÖ Environment variable configuration

## Configuration Options

All scripts respect the following environment variables:

- `BACKEND_PORT` - Backend service port (default: 8080)
- `FRONTEND_PORT` - Frontend service port (default: 3000)
- `BOT_SEARCH_DEPTH` - AI search depth (default: 2 for tests, 4 for production)

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- curl
- bash
- python3 (for JSON formatting)

## Output

Scripts provide:
- ‚úÖ Green checkmarks for passed tests
- ‚ùå Red X marks for failed tests
- üü° Yellow text for informational messages
- Detailed error messages and response bodies for debugging
